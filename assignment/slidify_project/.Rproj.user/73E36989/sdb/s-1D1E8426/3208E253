It's **that** easy !!!\n\n---\n\n## The Server Component\n\nAfter the user clicks the submit the following occurs.\n- the html is submitted to the server component\n- the server component calculates the variance from the submitted mean\n- the distribution is plotted\n- the selections are displayed \n\n\nI hope you enjoy using the Configurable Normal Distribution Grapher as much as I did in producing it!!!\n",
